\title{Filter taxa based on proportion of samples they are observed in.
Function from the phylosmith-package.}
\usage{
taxa_filter(phyloseq_obj, treatment = NULL, subset = NULL,
frequency = 0, below = FALSE, drop_samples = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{phyloseq_obj}{A \code{\link[phyloseq]{phyloseq-class}} object. It
must contain \code{\link[phyloseq:sample_data]{sample_data()}}) with
information about each sample, and it must contain
\code{\link[phyloseq:tax_table]{tax_table()}}) with information about each
taxa/gene.}

\item{treatment}{Column name as a \code{string} or \code{numeric} in the
\code{\link[phyloseq:sample_data]{sample_data}}. This can be a vector of
multiple columns and they will be combined into a new column.}

\item{subset}{A factor within the \code{treatment}. This will remove any
samples that to not contain this factor. This can be a vector of multiple
factors to subset on.}

\item{frequency}{The proportion of samples the taxa is found in.}

\item{below}{Does frequency define the minimum (\code{FALSE}) or maximum
(\code{TRUE}) proportion of samples the taxa is found in.}

\item{drop_samples}{Should the function remove samples that that are empty
after removing taxa filtered by frequency (\code{TRUE}).}

phyloseq-object
}
\description{
Inputs a phyloseq object and finds which taxa are seen in a
given proportion of samples, either in the entire dataset, by treatment, or
a particular treatment of interest.

\examples{
taxa_filter(soil_column, frequency = 0.8)
taxa_filter(soil_column, treatment = c("Matrix", "Treatment"),
subset = "Soil Amended", frequency = 0.8)
