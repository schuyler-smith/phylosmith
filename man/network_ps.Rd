\title{Create an igraph network object of the co-occurrence from a phyloseq object.
Function from the phylosmith-package.}
\usage{
network_ps(phyloseq_obj,
treatment = NULL, subset = NULL, co_occurrence_table = NULL, rho = 0.6)
}
\arguments{
\item{phyloseq_obj}{A \code{\link[phyloseq]{phyloseq-class}} object. It
must contain \code{\link[phyloseq:sample_data]{sample_data()}}) with
information about each sample, and it must contain
\code{\link[phyloseq:tax_table]{tax_table()}}) with information about each
taxa/gene.}

\item{treatment}{Column name as a string or number in the
\code{\link[phyloseq:sample_data]{sample_data}}. This can be a vector of
multiple columns and they will be combined into a new column.}

\item{subset}{A factor within the \code{treatment}. This will remove any
samples that to not contain this factor. This can be a vector of multiple
factors to subset on.}

\item{co_occurrence_table}{Table of the co-occurrence of taxa/genes in the
\code{phyloseq_obj}, computed using \code{\link{co_occurrence}}. If no
table is given, it will be computed with the \code{phyloseq_obj}, using the
given \code{treatment} and \code{p} = 0.05.}

\item{rho}{\code{numeric} The rho-value cutoff. All returned co-occurrences
will have a rho-value less than or equal to \code{rho} or less than or
equal to -\code{rho}.}
}
\value{
igraph network object
}
\description{
Create an igraph network object of the co-occurrence from a phyloseq object.
This can be input into the co_occurrence_network function, or used for other
network creating scripts. The purpose is to be able to create reproducible
and comparable graphics.

\examples{
network_ps(soil_column, treatment = c('Matrix', 'Treatment'),
subset = 'Soil Amended')
}
