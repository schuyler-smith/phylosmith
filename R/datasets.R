#' Soil Column 16S Data - OTUs
#'
#' This dataset was from an experiment that looked at how microbes from
#' manure used as fertilizer move through soil systems. The manure was
#' applied to the soil in a controlled system, and rain simulations were
#' conducted. The soil was tested at various time points, as was the water
#' that ran through the soil (effluent).
