<a href="https://github.com/schuyler-smith/phylosmith" targe="_blank" >phylosmith</a> is a supplementary package to build on the phyloseq-object from the [phyloseq](https://github.com/joey711/phyloseq) package. Phyloseq-objects are a great data-standard for microbiome and gene-expression data, this package is aimed to provied easy data-wrangling and visualization.

A lot of these functions are just to make "data-wrangling" easier for investigators. Others will implement complex routines in a, hopefully, efficient and concise manner. I have also made functions to make figures for quick examination of data, but they may or may not be suitable for publication, as some may require parameter optimization.

# Installation
## Requirements
### Linux Systems 
For some Linux systems you may need to install the following two programs through your terminal.

Ubuntu example:
```
sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev libgdal-dev libudunits2-dev
```
These programs are required by some dependancies and may not come in your default OS distribution.

### Windows Systems 

if you are working on WINDOWS you likely need to install the CRAN program <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/" target="_blank" >Rtools</a>.When prompted, select `add rtools to system PATH`.

### R

phylosmith depends on the usage of the [phyloseq package](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0061217) released by [Dr. Paul McMurdie](https://github.com/joey711). The pacakge is maintained on BioConductor, and can be installed through R using the following commands:

```
if(!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)){
  install.packages("BiocManager")
} 
BiocManager::install("phyloseq")
```

Additionally, the package imports a number of other packages to use their advanced functions. These packages may install with the phylosmith installation, but it is always best to install independently.

```
install.packages(c("devtools", RcppEigen", "RcppParallel", "Rtsne", "ggforce", "units"))
```

## phylosmith

The package is hosted on Github, and can be installed through R with:
```
devtools::install_github('schuyler-smith/phylosmith')
library(phylosmith)
```

### Datasets
Originally I had created 2 mock phyloseq objects (`mock_phyloseq` and `mock_phyloseq2`) that had no real-world data but served to show simple examples of how the functions worked. 

Then I decided that I should include a real example of microbiome data (`soil_column`) becasue it's always nice to see real examples. `soil_column` is a <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2018.03197/full" target="_blank" >published dataset</a>  from my lab-group. The data is from an experiment where they looked at the microbial composition of farmland soil before and after manure application, over time, using 16S-sequencing.
